# makefile to download and install the Redactive-patched Backup Migrate S3 module and accompanying code to allow
# automated off-site backups to the Redactive S3 database buckets.
# ----------------
# Example use:
#
# cd /path/to/repo (not /path/to/repo/www)
# drush make redactive_backup_migrate_s3_customisations_make.yml www --no-core

# Core version
# ------------
# Each makefile should begin by declaring the core version of Drupal that all
# projects should be compatible with.

core: "7.x"

# API version
# ------------
# Every makefile needs to declare it's Drush Make API version. This version of
# drush make uses API version `2`.

api: 2

# Core project
# ------------
# In order for your makefile to generate a full Drupal site, you must include
# a core project. This is usually Drupal core, but you can also specify
# alternative core projects like Pressflow. Note that makefiles included with
# install profiles *should not* include a core project.

# Use Pressflow instead of Drupal core:
# projects:
#   pressflow:
#     type: "core"
#     download:
#       type: "file"
#       url: "http://launchpad.net/pressflow/6.x/6.15.73/+download/pressflow-6.15.73.tar.gz"
#
# Git clone of Drupal 7.x. Requires the `core` property to be set to 7.x.
# projects
#   drupal:
#     type: "core"
#     download:
#       url: "https://git.drupalcode.org/project/drupal.git"

projects:
  # Projects
  # --------
  # Each project that you would like to include in the makefile should be
  # declared under the `projects` key. The simplest declaration of a project
  # looks like this:

  backup_migrate:
    version: "3.6"
    type: "module"
  #    download:
  #      overwrite: TRUE

  backup_migrate_s3:
    type: "module"
    subdir: "patched"
    download:
      type: "git" # Note, 'git' is the default, no need to specify.
      url: "git@bitbucket.org:redactivemedia/backup_migrate_s3.git"
      #      tag: "20190925132212"
      overwrite: TRUE

  redactive_backup_migrate_s3_customisations:
    type: "module"
    subdir: "custom"
    download:
      type: "git" # Note, 'git' is the default, no need to specify.
      url: "git@bitbucket.org:redactivemedia/redactive_backup_migrate_s3_customisations.git"
      #      tag: "20190925134422"
      overwrite: TRUE

libraries:
  aws-sdk-php:
    download:
      type: "get"
      url: "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/releases/download/2.8.30/aws.zip"
      destination: "libraries"
      overwrite: TRUE

# If all projects or libraries share common attributes, the `defaults`
# array can be used to specify these globally, rather than
# per-project.

defaults:
  projects:
    subdir: "contrib"
